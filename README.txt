This project is a car-driving game that has a top-down view. The player’s car is always at the center and the background mimics the real-world roads with obstacles that the car must not collide into, such as other cars, bicycles, etc. The project also contains an AI portion of the game, which drives staying on the road without colliding with the randomly generated obstacles. A map generation algorithm creates new maps every time. 
To run the game, run the ‘main.py’ file. Make sure 112 graphics is downloaded in the same folder as the file.
